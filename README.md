Hello I'm Igu, a 16 year's old, brazilian coding student since 21/08/2021.
I did an excellent python course from a well known Brazilian youtuber wich got my interest in coding.
RN I'm taking CS50 wich is being very hard but also teaching me a lot of stuff.
I plan to graduate in Computer's Science.
Feel free to contact me for anything, I might see faster if in Gmail tho.
